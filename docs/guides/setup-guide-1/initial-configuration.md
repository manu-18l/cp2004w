# Initial Configuration Wizard

The final step of the wizard, you should be presented with two key settings to edit:

* **Strip Type** Select the type of strip you have connected to your Pi.  **Note:** This may not be exactly what you were sold, sometimes they send variations. If you have issues, please try similar strip types here.
* **Number of LEDs** This should be easy, count the number of LEDs you have connected and enter the right number!

For more details on the rest of these settings, please see the [full documentation](../../configuration/led-strip-configuration.md) of the LED Strip configuration.

{% hint style="success" %}
**That's it! WS281x LED Status Setup is** _**complete!**_

If you haven't already, reboot your Pi for the changes in the previous step, OS Configuration/SPI Setup to take effect. Enjoy your LEDs ðŸ™‚âœ¨
