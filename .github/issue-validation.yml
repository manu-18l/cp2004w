  Hi @@@AUTHOR@@,

  
  It looks like there is some information missing from this issue that is required to process it:

    * It looks like you haven't read the ['Get Help Guide'](https://cp2004.gitbook.io/ws281x-led-status/guides/get-help-guide)

  
  Please read this guide, especially the [troubleshooting](https://cp2004.gitbook.io/ws281x-led-status/troubleshooting-guide) section.

  
  If you have read this guide, please tick the box in your issue next to 'I have read the Get Help Guide'

  
  ```
  * [x] I have read the Get Help Guide
  ```
  
  
  If you didn't mean to ask for help, please make sure you used the right template - 
  bugs and requests should have `[Bug]` and `[Request]` respectively in the title.
  
  
  *I'm just a bot ðŸ¤–, not a human being, so don't expect any replies
  from me :) Your ticket is read by humans too, I'm just not one of them.*

keyphrase: "[x] I have read the Get Help Guide"
