A highly configurable plugin for supporting WS2811, WS2812 and SK6812 LEDs attached to your Raspberry Pi.

With lots of effects to choose from, you can customise the plugin to do things *exactly* as you want them, to display the status from your 3D printer from a simple strip of LEDs

Features include:
* Reacting to printing events
* Tracking heating & printing progress
* Intercepting M150 commands
* Quick on/off button from the navbar
* 'Torch' button
* A timer to turn the LEDs on or off at certain times
* Easy to use but highly configurable settings interface, you can turn pretty much anything on or off.
* LED Strip test
* Power calculator
* ... and more!

You can take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/cp2004/OctoPrint-WS281x_LED_Status/wiki) for more information about all that the plugin has to offer.
