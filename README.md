A highly configurable plugin for supporting WS2811, WS2812 and SK6812 LEDs attached to your Raspberry Pi.

With lots of effects to choose from, you can customise the plugin to do things _exactly_ as you want them, to display the status from your 3D printer from a simple strip of LEDs

Features include:

- Reacting to printing events
- Tracking heating & printing progress
- Intercepting M150 commands
- Quick on/off button from the navbar
- 'Torch' button
- A timer to turn the LEDs on or off at certain times
- Easy to use but highly configurable settings interface, you can turn pretty much anything on or off.
- LED Strip test
- Power calculator
- ... and more!

You can take a look at the [documentation](https://cp2004.gitbook.io/ws281x-led-status/) for more information about all that the plugin has to offer.
